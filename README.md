Investment Calculator (React.js)

A simple investment calculator built with React.js that demonstrates core React concepts such as lifting state up, code splitting, and passing props. The app allows users to input investment parameters and displays results for each year of the investment period.

Features

âœ… Built using functional components and hooks

âœ… Lifting state up to manage input and results in a single parent component

âœ… Code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense to load large components on demand

âœ… Passing props down to reusable child components for display and formatting

âœ… Clean UI and modular component structure

Key Concepts Used

ðŸ”¼ Lifting State Up

All input values are stored in the App.jsx component and passed down to InvestmentForm and Result as props. This allows the entire app to share a single source of truth for investment data.

ðŸ”¼ Code Splitting

The Result component is lazy-loaded using React.lazy() to improve initial load time.
